# Mapping and charting the Ebola outbreak
This map was created with [TileMill](http://mapbox.com/tilemill) and [Mapbox.js](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v2.0.1/).

The bar chart was generated with [d3.js](d3js.org).

The data was curated by @dereklieu, who is much better at mapmaking than I am. You should see his [talk he gave at AAJA's Day of Data](https://github.com/dereklieu/talks/tree/20140813-aaja-dataday).
